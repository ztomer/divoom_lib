"""BLE Hardening Phase 1 — honest connect/reconnect.

A typed connection result + a retrying ``ensure_connected`` helper so the rest
of the stack stops returning dead device handles and starts surfacing
ACTIONABLE reasons (device asleep, BT off, held by the phone app, …) instead of
a bare "timed out".

The helper operates on any object with an async ``connect()`` and an
``is_connected`` property (the real ``Divoom``/transport, or the fake in
``tests/support/fake_ble.py``), so every path is unit-testable without hardware.
