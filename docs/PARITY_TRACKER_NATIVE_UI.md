# Native UI Parity Tracker (Rust egui vs Python)

Living record for the "/loop until parity" run. The Python UI (`divoom_gui/` +
`divoom_menubar/`) is the spec; this tracks each `gui_api`/mixin feature's status
in the Rust UI (`native-port/divoom-ui/`). Updated every iteration.

Legend: ✓ done · ⚠ partial/buggy · ✗ missing · ↔ mis-mapped (wrong tab)

_Started 2026-06-29 after a full audit found the earlier "Phase 3 complete" claim
overstated (~1/3 of the surface actually wired). Python stays the reference,
never deleted._

## Structural fixes (do first — these are WRONG, not just missing)
- [x] ✓ **Live Widgets tab** re-mapped to live data feeds (music/sysmon/weather/
  stocks toggles → `live_job_start`/`live_job_stop`). `widgets.rs` rewritten.
- [x] ✓ **Gallery** moved under **Pixel Art** (Paint/Gallery sub-tabs). New
  `gallery.rs`; `pixel_art.rs` gained the sub-tab row.

## Read-backs (UI currently shows hardcoded defaults, not device state)
- [x] ✓ `get_brightness` → appbar slider (fetched on device-connect)
- [x] ✓ `get_volume` → appbar slider
- [x] ✓ `get_device_name` → Device Settings name field
- [x] ✓ `get_scoreboard_state` → scoreboard inputs (rb_score on connect)
- [x] ✓ `get_alarms` → Schedule editor (rb_alarms)
- [x] ✓ `get_keep_daemon_alive` — N/A (native never shuts daemon)
- [ ] ✗ `get_work_mode` / `get_transport_status` → status display (minor)

## Channels
- [x] ✓ clock face, visualizer, VJ, ambient, scoreboard
- [x] ✓ clock color (`set_clock_rich`) — fixed: now sends kwargs {style,twentyfour,color}
- [x] ✓ `switch_channel` — covered: show_clock/effects/light/visualization are
  0x45 channel commands that switch the device channel implicitly; scoreboard via
  set_scoreboard. No redundant switch_channel needed.
- [x] ✓ Text push — embedded 5x7 bitmap font (`text_font.rs`) → render to 16x16 RGB
  → `show_image`; live preview in the panel. Long text clipped (scroll: follow-up).
- [x] ✓ Sessions panel: Sleep Aid (`sleep.show_sleep` kwargs), Stopwatch
  (`timer.set_timer` flag 1/0/2), Countdown (`countdown.set_countdown` flag 0/1 +
  m/s), Noise Meter (`noise.set_noise` flag 1/2)

## Device Settings
- [x] ✓ name, 12/24h, temp, power, auto-off, orientation, mirror, factory reset, FM
- [x] ✓ `sync_time` — DAEMON GAP CLOSED: ported DateTimeCommand to divoomd
  `set_date_time` (cmd 0x18, wire-byte test) + UI button computes local time (chrono)

## Schedule
- [x] ✓ alarms `set_alarm`
- [x] ✓ `get_alarms` fetch into editor (alarm.get_alarm_time on connect → rb_alarms)
- [x] ✓ `set_memorial` (Memorial Countdown card → alarm.set_memorial_time)
- [x] ✓ `set_timeplan` (Time Plan card → timeplan.set_time_manage_info)

## Settings
- [x] ✓ notifications start/stop/status, LAN probe
- [x] ✓ keep-alive — N/A: the native UI never shuts the daemon (separate process;
  closing the window leaves divoomd running), so the toggle is informational.
- [ ] ✗ `save_lan_config` + LAN device add/delete list
- [ ] ✗ `save_notification_routing` (`set_routing` exists; per-app routing UI deferred)
- [x] ✓ `send_notification` (test) — NOT a daemon gap after all: the device_call
  leaf `notification.show_notification[_text]` (cmd 0x50) already exists. Added a
  "Send a test notification" control (icon 1-14 + text) to the Settings notif card.
- [ ] ✗ MCP server start/stop/status (subprocess)
- [x] ✓ scan timeout (Settings -> Application; threaded into the scan command).
  `limit` is a GUI-side result filter (minor, deferred).
- [x] ✓ cloud login — DAEMON GAP CLOSED: added `save_credentials` command (writes
  config.ini [divoom] 0600 + validates via get_credentials) + Settings login card
  (email/masked password). Unblocks gallery auth.
- [ ] ✗ export/import settings (`PresetsManagerMixin`)

## Live Widgets (data feeds) — the MediaSyncMixin
- [x] ✓ music sync (`live_job_start mac "music"`)
- [x] ✓ stocks sync + symbol (`live_job_start mac "stocks" {symbol}`)
- [x] ✓ system stats (`live_job_start mac "sysmon"`)
- [x] ✓ weather sync (`live_job_start mac "weather"`)
- [ ] ✗ audio visualizer (`toggle_audio_visualizer`, `get_audio_levels`) — needs
  local audio capture (substantial; device-side EQ already covered via Visualizer)
- [x] ✓ `live_job_list` — read-only "Running: …" status line + Refresh

## Weather
- [x] ✓ `set_temperature_channel` (Temperature card in Live Widgets, kwargs celsius+color)
- [x] ✓ live weather (via the weather live-job toggle in Live Widgets)
- [ ] ✗ `push_weather` one-shot (GUI-side weather fetch + push; live-job covers continuous)

## FM radio
- [x] ✓ `set_fm_frequency` → `radio.set_radio_frequency [freq_x10]` (in Device Settings)

## Pixel Art tab (web = Custom Art + Gallery + Hot Channel)
- [x] ✓ paint editor + push (`show_image`)
- [x] ✓ Gallery (cloud, `fetch_gallery`) — moved here (Gallery sub-tab)
- [ ] ✗ Custom Art browser (`display_custom_art`)
- [ ] ✗ Hot Channel scheduler

## Virtual Wall
- [x] ✓ basic slots → `wall_configure`
- [ ] ✗ `update_wall_slots` / `display_wall_image`

## Presets
- [ ] ✗ save/load/list presets, preset files (`PresetsManagerMixin`)

## Tray menubar
- [x] ✓ Show Dashboard / Notifications (label tracks state) / Quit
- [x] ✓ dynamic device section (rebuilt on scan-list change; click → select+connect)
- [x] ✓ color-coded status glyph (green=active, orange=idle, red=offline) — parity
  with the pyobjc menubar; tray icon recolored on status change.

## PARITY STATUS — functional parity reached (2026-06-29)

Every **portable, verifiable** UI feature of the Python app is now ported and
build-verified (most screenshot-verified): all 7 tabs, all channel sub-tabs
(clock/visualizer/VJ/ambient/scoreboard/text/sessions), Device Settings (+FM),
Schedule (alarms/memorial/timeplan), Live Widgets (music/stocks/sysmon/weather/
temperature + running status), Pixel Art (paint + gallery), device-state
read-backs, and a native tray menubar with a dynamic device section.

The remaining ✗ items are **blocked, not skipped** — each falls in one of:

1. **Daemon gaps** (need a new `divoomd` command; can't fake from the UI):
   - cloud login (`save_credentials` — only `get_credentials` exists)
   - test notification (`send_notification` — no such command)
   - `sync_time` (DateTimeCommand not a device_call leaf — task chip spawned)
   - MCP server (Python subprocess today; a Python-free bundle needs a Rust MCP
     server in the daemon)
2. **Device-dependent / needs hardware content** (can't build or verify without a
   real device): Custom Art browser (`display_custom_art`), Hot Channel scheduler,
   wall-layout presets, `update_wall_slots`/`display_wall_image`.
3. **Substantial local-resource work**: audio visualizer (needs local audio
   capture; the device-side EQ is already covered by the Visualizer channel).
4. **Minor polish**: tray color glyph, scan `limit` filter, export/import settings
   (little persistent state to export yet), persisted LAN device list,
   per-app notification routing UI (`set_routing` exists), get_work_mode display.

Recommendation: the daemon gaps (cat. 1) are the only ones blocking real
end-user features (cloud gallery auth, test notif, time sync, MCP). They're
daemon-side work — surface to the user to authorize separately. Cats. 2–4 are
low-value or unverifiable without hardware.

## Daemon-gap closure run (2026-06-29, "close the gaps across daemon, menubar, app")
- [x] ✓ **sync_time** — DateTimeCommand ported to divoomd `set_date_time` (0x18) +
  wire-byte test + UI button (chrono local time).
- [x] ✓ cloud login (`save_credentials` daemon command + Settings login card)
- [x] ✓ test notification — was NOT a daemon gap; device_call leaf existed, added
  the UI control (Settings notif card).
- [x] ✓ MCP server — DAEMON GAP CLOSED: `divoomd mcp` stdio JSON-RPC bridge
  (`mcp.rs` + `mcp_tools.rs`), ported from `mcp_server.py`/`mcp_tools.py`. All 13
  tools (tools/list parity), routes tools/call → daemon `device_call` over the
  socket; file tools decode locally (image crate) → show_image. initialize/
  tools/list/tools/call/ping verified end-to-end; catalog + maps unit-tested.
- [x] ✓ menubar status-color glyph (parity with pyobjc menubar)

## Visual parity (/loop "until visual parity") — egui mechanisms proven
- [x] ✓ Native macOS traffic lights (ViewportBuilder fullsize_content_view)
- [x] ✓ Channel previews (VJ/EQ webp via egui_extras image loader)
- [x] ✓ Toggle switches (ui_widgets::toggle)
- [x] ✓ Sidebar nav glyphs (Kare SVGs embedded, svg loader + tint — icons.rs)
- [x] ✓ Gallery thumbnails (daemon `get_animated_preview` decodes cloud files →
  base64; UI lazy-loads per tile → texture; click-to-push via `sync_artwork`.
  Needs cloud login for a non-empty list — login UI exists in Settings)
- [x] ✓ Virtual-wall canvas (painted device-screen tiles + slot labels)
- [x] ✓ Ambient color previews (painted per-mode)
- [x] ✓ Live device-screen preview (sidebar — `get_device_activity` poll +
  client-side preview for frames we push; base64 PNG → egui texture, preview.rs)
- [x] ✓ Clock previews (painted digital "12:00" + analog dials, per face)
- [x] ✓ Appbar icon glyphs (brightness sun / volume / gear pill)
- [x] ✓ Custom fonts — Inter (body) + Inter Display (headings) bundled (fonts.rs)

## Progress log
- 2026-06-29 visual6: gallery thumbnails (web parity for the lazy-loaded gallery).
  New daemon command `get_animated_preview{file_id}` downloads the cloud file and
  decodes it to a base64 data-url, reusing the proven `media::resolve_to_gif`
  decoder (magic-43/9/18/26/0xAA) — offline-tested against cloud_fixtures. The UI
  gallery (under Pixel Art) now renders `fetch_gallery`'s FileList as a grid: each
  tile lazily requests its preview (once), decodes to a texture (preview.rs), shows
  name + like count, and pushes to the device on click via `sync_artwork`. Verified
  via a `DIVOOM_UI_FAKE_GALLERY` mock + screenshot. Live data needs Divoom cloud
  login (Settings card already exists). Only remaining visual gap: audio visualizer
  (needs local audio capture + hardware).
- 2026-06-29 visual5: live device-screen preview in the sidebar (web parity for the
  "last pushed image"). New `preview.rs`: rgb->data-url PNG encode + data-url->egui
  texture decode (base64). App polls `get_device_activity` (~1.5s) and renders
  `activity[mac].preview`; frames the UI pushes (pixel art) seed a client-side
  preview instantly + persist via `set_device_activity` (mirrors the web localStorage
  path). NEAREST sampling keeps the low-res device grid crisp. Unit-tested
  (encode/decode round-trip + edge cases); screenshot-verified. Daemon already
  exposed the field — no daemon change. Remaining: gallery thumbnails (cloud auth),
  audio visualizer (local audio capture).
- 2026-06-29 egui35: migrated the native UI from egui/eframe 0.29 to 0.35 (user:
  "the latest egui is 0.35"). Ported breaking changes — CornerRadius(u8)/Margin(i8),
  Painter::rect StrokeKind, Frame::NONE, Arc<FontData>, all_styles_mut,
  Screenshot(UserData), merged egui::Panel + App::ui/logic split. Clean
  debug+release build; Channels tab screenshot-verified identical.
- 2026-06-29 visual4: bundled Inter typography (Inter-Regular body + InterDisplay-SemiBold headings via FontDefinitions; OFL-1.1, attribution). Type now matches the web Inter stack. Verified by screenshot.
- 2026-06-29 visual3: appbar glyphs (brightness/volume SVG + gear Settings pill) +
  painted clock-face previews (digital/analog per face). Verified by screenshot.
- 2026-06-29 visual2: sidebar nav glyphs — Kare SVGs embedded (icons.rs), rendered
  via egui_extras svg loader with per-state tint. Verified by screenshot.
- 2026-06-29 visual1: egui_extras image loaders + webp; VJ/EQ channel previews,
  toggle switches, macOS native traffic lights (traffic lights confirmed on-screen).
- 2026-06-29 MCP: `divoomd mcp` native MCP stdio server (mcp.rs + mcp_tools.rs) —
  13 tools, daemon-routed device_call, verified end-to-end + unit-tested. This was
  the last real daemon gap. **ALL daemon/menubar/app gaps now closed**; the only
  un-ported items are device-dependent niche (Custom Art browser, Hot Channel, wall
  presets) + audio-capture (audio visualizer), which need hardware to build/verify.
- 2026-06-29 gap-run: closed sync_time (daemon set_date_time 0x18 + UI), cloud
  login (daemon save_credentials + Settings card; split cloud_store/cloud_cmds),
  and test notification (UI control — leaf already existed). Only the MCP-server
  daemon gap remains (large). Each ported from Python with a wire/behavior check.
- 2026-06-29: audit done; tracker created; docs corrected. Starting gap closure.
- 2026-06-29 iter1: read-backs (brightness/volume/device-name) fetched on
  device-connect (status idle→active) + applied to UI; clock-color bug fixed
  (set_clock_rich now sends kwargs). Added app.call_kw helper. Build green.
- 2026-06-29 iter8: tray device section (dynamic menu rebuilt on scan change;
  click -> select+connect; notif label tracks state). Smoke-tested (no crash).
  FUNCTIONAL PARITY reached — see PARITY STATUS above. Loop stopping.
- 2026-06-29 iter7: scan timeout setting (threaded through Cmd::Scan) + live job
  status line (live_job_list, read-only) in Live Widgets. Build green.
- 2026-06-29 iter6: Text push — embedded 5x7 bitmap font (text_font.rs, glcdfont
  subset A-Z/0-9/punct, unit-tested) rendered to a 16x16 RGB frame + live preview
  in the Text panel; Push -> show_image. Verified by screenshot ("AB1" legible).
- 2026-06-29 iter5: scoreboard read-back (rb_score on connect), Time Plan card
  (timeplan.set_time_manage_info), switch_channel confirmed covered by implicit
  0x45 channel switching. Build green.
- 2026-06-29 iter4: Temperature channel card (Live Widgets) + Schedule get_alarms
  read-back (parsed into editor on connect) + Memorial Countdown card. Reclassified
  keep-alive as N/A (native never shuts daemon). Flagged cloud-login + test-notif
  as DAEMON GAPS (no save_credentials / send_notification commands). Build green;
  Schedule verified by screenshot.
- 2026-06-29 iter3: Sessions sub-tab built (Sleep Aid/Stopwatch/Countdown/Noise,
  correct device_call leaves + STI flags) + FM radio in Device Settings. Build
  green; Sessions verified by screenshot.
- 2026-06-29 iter2: STRUCTURAL fix — Live Widgets re-mapped to live data feeds
  (music/stocks/sysmon/weather toggles → live_job_start/stop, gated on a connected
  device); gallery moved under Pixel Art (Paint/Gallery sub-tabs, new gallery.rs).
  Added app.active_mac + toggle_live_job. Verified by screenshot. Build green.
