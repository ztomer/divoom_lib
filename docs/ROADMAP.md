## Current debt & quality

- **500-LOC rule**: fully enforced, ALLOWLIST empty (R23).
- **Font**: APK bitmap font extracted (ASCII + CJK via `from_apk_asset()`), half-size variant with majority-rule downsampling.
- **Tests**: hardware tests gated/skip by default; 60 native-downscaler parity tests; alarms editor JS guard; 18 E2E mock-device.
- **C module**: `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler) compiled via `build_libdivoom.sh`; normalize-then-quantize kernel matches PIL byte-for-byte (60/60 parity tests).

## Open workstreams

### Near-term (next round)

| Workstream | Depends on | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **MCP hardware-verify** | R28 (MCP-via-daemon) | Drive a real device through `divoom-control mcp-server` end-to-end. |
| **Exclusive-mode hardware verify** | R29 | Drive a real multi-step sequence through the proxy exclusive context. |

### Short-to-medium term

| Workstream | Depends on | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **`show_clock()` overlay reorder** | — | Align overlay positions with APK C2() layout (current has mismatched humidity/weather/date coords). |
| **`get_*` read-back timeouts** | — | Real hardware read-back commands time out (mitigated: alarms `alarms.json` cache). |
| **R12 visual pass** | user-driven | Glass tab strip, appbar corners, etc. |
| **R12 hardware verification** | user-driven | Album cover, custom-art/live/weather on real device. |

### Divoom Cloud HTTP (200+ endpoints)

**Status: DEFERRED** (R9 §D, R12_D_AUDIT). Would be its own round.

The official Divoom app communicates with `appin.divoom-gz.com` via HTTP/JSON for:
- Clock-face store (browse, download, upload)
- Weather city search
- Pomodoro timer presets
- White-noise tracks
- TTS (text-to-speech)
- Community gallery (browse, upload, like, comment)

**Blockers:**
1. **Cloud auth broken**: `UserNewGuest` returns `RC=10` (the public API may have changed or requires a different flow).
2. **Scope**: 200+ endpoints. A useful round would pick a small set (clock-face store + 1-2 others), not all of them.
3. **New transport**: requires a new `divoom_lib/cloud/` module — the library is currently BLE-only + device LAN.

### Deferred (R12 §D)

See `docs/PLANNING_ROUND12_D_AUDIT.md` for the full audit:
- `pic_scan_ctrl` 0x35 claim — lib says it sends 0x35 but the decompiled APK has no such command ID.
- Cloud HTTP surface (above).
