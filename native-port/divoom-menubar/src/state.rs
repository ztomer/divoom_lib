//! Pure icon-state resolution (R61 follow-up).
//!
//! Before this, the menubar's icon color came ONLY from `daemon::status()`,
//! which reflects the macOS notification monitor's activity — NOT whether a
//! Divoom device is BLE/LAN connected. `resolve_icon_state` combines both
//! signals: device connection health is the primary, more actionable signal
//! for an at-a-glance icon (mirrors the Python GUI's `transport-dot`
//! precedence in `divoom_gui/web_ui/connection_events.js` — dropped beats
//! degraded beats connected); notification-monitor activity is folded into
//! the tooltip only, so that existing signal isn't silently lost, just
//! demoted from icon color to a detail string.
