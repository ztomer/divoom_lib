"""py2app build recipe → a self-contained ``Divoom.app``.

    python setup_app.py py2app          # build dist/Divoom.app
    (driven by scripts/build_release.sh in a dedicated build venv)

What ships: the four runtime packages (divoom_lib / divoom_daemon / divoom_gui /
divoom_menubar) and their package data (web_ui/, fonts/, the native dylib), plus
the third-party runtime deps (bleak, aiohttp, Pillow, pywebview, pyobjc).

What does NOT ship — enforced by `excludes` + listing only the runtime packages:
references/ (the decompiled APK + third-party reference projects), tests/,
scripts/, examples/, docs/. The app must never bundle the reverse-engineered APK.

The Info.plist declares the Bluetooth usage descriptions so the bundle is its own
TCC "responsible process" and macOS shows the normal Allow-Bluetooth prompt
(instead of crashing on first CoreBluetooth touch). See scripts/make_app_bundle.sh
for the background.
