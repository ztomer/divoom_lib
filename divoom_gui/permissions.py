"""Up-front macOS permission priming.

Some features touch TCC-gated resources lazily. The worst offender: the album-art
live widget controls Music/Spotify via AppleScript (Apple Events / "Automation"),
and that osascript runs inside the HEADLESS daemon — so the consent dialog had no
visible owner and the user never saw it, the Apple Event was denied, and the
widget silently got no track (the device channel never changed, while the GUI
preview rendered a local placeholder).

Fix: trigger the prompts at GUI startup, from the FOREGROUND app, so they're
visible and granted once up front. The grant is attributed to the responsible
bundle (Divoom.app), which the daemon it spawns inherits — so the daemon's later
osascript calls just work.

Bluetooth is already primed by the daemon's first scan (its prompt is declared in
the Info.plist and surfaces because the GUI is foreground), so it isn't repeated
here.
