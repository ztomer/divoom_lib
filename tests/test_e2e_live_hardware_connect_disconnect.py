"""Live-hardware connect/disconnect feedback verification (R61 follow-up, opt-in).

Unlike test_e2e_gui_daemon_connect_disconnect.py (an isolated daemon + mock
transport, safe for CI), this file drives the REAL default daemon socket
(``/tmp/divoom.sock``) — whatever daemon/device is actually running on this
machine, e.g. the user's live menubar + a real Divoom device. Skipped by
default (added to ``conftest.py``'s ``HARDWARE_TEST_MODULES``); run with::

    pytest tests/test_e2e_live_hardware_connect_disconnect.py --run-hardware

Deliberately READ-ONLY: it verifies the daemon's honest status reporting is
internally consistent (the same correctness property the isolated suite
checks with a mock transport), but never issues a connect/disconnect against
the live device. A real write-cycle test would mean disconnecting whatever
the user is actually using at the moment they happen to run the suite — on a
SHARED daemon there's no way to tell "idle, safe to disturb" from "someone is
mid-session with this device" from the outside. If you want to exercise a
real connect/disconnect cycle by hand, drive the daemon directly:

    python3 -c "from divoom_daemon.daemon_protocol import DaemonClient; \\
        c = DaemonClient('/tmp/divoom.sock'); print(c.device_status())"

The menubar's own live icon state isn't asserted on here either — reading a
real NSStatusItem's tooltip from outside the process needs macOS
Accessibility automation, which is a separate, heavier piece of tooling this
file intentionally doesn't take on. What IS asserted: the same daemon
`device_status`/`connection_state` contract the menubar (native-port/
divoom-menubar/src/daemon.rs::connection_state) and the GUI (divoom_gui/
scanner_mixin.py::get_connection_state) both read UI feedback from — so a
live run at least proves that contract holds against real (not mocked)
daemon state, whatever it currently is.
