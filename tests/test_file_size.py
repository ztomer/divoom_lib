"""The 500-LOC rule, enforced (see ARCHITECTURE.md + docs/REVIEW_2026-06.md §1).

No tracked source file under divoom_lib / divoom_daemon / divoom_gui may exceed
500 lines. Existing offenders are pinned in ALLOWLIST as acknowledged debt — the
list may only SHRINK. A new oversized file fails the suite; shrinking an allowed
file below 500 and not removing it from the list also fails (so the debt is
actively retired, not forgotten).
