"""E2E device-status reporting — the per-device selector chips.

Drives the real web_ui in headless Chromium with a mock ``pywebview.api`` and
asserts the sidebar device chips always reflect the REAL state of each screen:
the active device, a daemon-owned streaming device, a degraded link, a
known-but-undetected device (R50), LAN devices, and daemon-owned devices that a
scan missed. Backend honesty is in ``test_device_status.py``; the appbar dot in
``test_e2e_device_status_dot.py``. Skipped if Playwright / a browser isn't
