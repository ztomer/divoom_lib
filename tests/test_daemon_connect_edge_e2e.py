"""Hardware-free daemon connect/disconnect edge-case e2e (R57).

Drives a REAL divoomd process (spawned by ``ensure_daemon``) over a real Unix
socket, but uses the daemon's built-in ``mock`` transport (``connect`` with
``{"mock": true}`` → ``MockTransport``) and an unreachable LAN IP for the
"device is off / not there" case. No Bluetooth, no real device.

This is the orchestration half of the bulletproof matrix: the Rust side
(``central.rs`` / ``daemon_connect.rs``) proves the BLE layer can't hang on a
dead central; this file proves the daemon's connect/disconnect/device-lifecycle
state machine stays coherent and responsive across the nasty sequences a user
can actually trigger — mid-flight disconnect, reconnect loops, connect to a
device that isn't there, connect-while-already-connected, and device ops after
disconnect.
