"""Shared pytest configuration.

Several ``test_*_functions.py`` modules are *hardware integration* tests: their
``asyncSetUp`` calls ``discover_device()`` which spins up a real ``BleakScanner``
/ CoreBluetooth central manager. On a machine without granted Bluetooth
permission (e.g. CI, or a sandboxed shell) that triggers a macOS TCC privacy
violation which **aborts the whole interpreter**, taking the rest of the suite
down with it.

To keep the unit-test suite runnable and give a real pass/fail baseline, these
hardware tests are skipped by default. Run them against a real device with::

    pytest --run-hardware

# exited, letting it survive into a later, unrelated test. DeviceOwner.stop()
# now joins that thread (and bounds its executor shutdown) to close the gap —
# this fixture is the trip-wire: if a thread named "device-loop" is EVER still
# alive after a test, fail LOUDLY and name the offending test, instead of
# leaving it to surface as an unrelated mock/decode failure hundreds of tests
# later. Scoped to this one thread name (unique to OwnerLoopMixin) so it can't
# false-positive on unrelated threads (notification monitor, socket server...).
