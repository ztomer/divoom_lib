"""E2E device-status reporting — the appbar connection-state dot.

Drives the real web_ui in headless Chromium with a mock ``pywebview.api`` and
asserts the global status dot always reflects the device's REAL link state
(connected / degraded / disconnected) and never a stale or misleading one.

The dot is driven by the EVENT path R59 shipped: the GUI subscribes to the
daemon and forwards every ``status`` event to ``window.Divoom.onDaemonEvent``
(see divoom_gui/web_ui/connection_events.js). The old 4s ``refreshConnectionState``
polling heartbeat is gone (kept only as a documented safety net — one test
below still exercises it). Backend honesty (ScannerMixin.get_connection_state)
is in ``test_device_status.py``; per-device chips in
``test_e2e_device_status_chips.py``. Skipped if Playwright / a browser isn't
installed.
