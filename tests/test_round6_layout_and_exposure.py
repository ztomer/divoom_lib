"""Playwright + static-analysis regression tests for the Round 6 layout
changes documented in `docs/PLANNING_ROUND5.md` §3 and §4.

What this test file covers:

1. **Monthly Best layout (Option B):** the right card is now 23% width
   (grid `1.6fr 0.6fr`), the MAC address is gone from the sync-target
   rows, and the schedule block is removed from Monthly Best.
2. **Routines sub-tab:** Settings has a new "Routines" sub-tab that
   contains the auto-sync schedule, renamed from "Hot-Channel Schedule"
   to "Auto-Sync Gallery" per user pick.
3. **Volume slider in appbar:** the new appbar volume slider exists
   with a 0-15 range and the right label format.
4. **Scoreboard channel-card:** the new Scoreboard channel-card is
   in the Control Panel with the right number inputs and Show/Hide
   buttons.

Why static-analysis + Playwright, not full behavioral tests:
- The drag behavior already has its own dedicated test file
  (`test_gui_drag_instrumented.py`).
- These tests are about *layout existence and shape*, not user
  interaction. Static analysis catches regressions at the source
  level; Playwright catches them at the rendered DOM level.
- Hardware-gated BLE interactions (volume, scoreboard) cannot be
  tested headlessly; their transport-level correctness is covered
  by the existing `test_e2e_mock_device.py` test file.
