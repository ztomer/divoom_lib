"""
Regression guard for the frameless window drag mechanism.

The window drag is handled by pywebview's built-in drag-region
mechanism (`gui/web_ui/index.html` <header class="integrated-appbar
pywebview-drag-region">) + the cocoa `BrowserView.move` patched
in `gui/gui_main.py` per upstream issue #1820 (May 2026).

This file contains static-analysis guards. The actual drag behavior
can only be verified by manual test on a real macOS window, because:

1. pywebview's bundled `customize.js` is only injected by pywebview's
   `start()` (not by loading the HTML in a plain browser), so a
   Playwright test that serves the HTML over HTTP will not exercise
   the drag handler.
2. The Cocoa `setFrameTopLeftPoint_` call is in Python and only
   takes effect on a real NSWindow, so it cannot be observed from
   a headless browser.
3. The upstream #1820 patch is a no-op on single-monitor setups
   (the most common test environment), so a CI test on single-
   monitor would not detect a regression in the multi-monitor
   coordinate handling.

The structural guards below catch the regressions that have actually
broken the drag in prior rounds (custom JS handler re-added, custom
Python `drag_window` re-added, `pywebview-drag-region` class dropped,
#1820 patch removed or wrong).
