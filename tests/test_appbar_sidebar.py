"""Playwright regression tests for sidebar/appbar layout:

- R32: the bottom-right connectivity indicator pill (`.corner-transports`) was
  removed — the per-device sidebar dots convey state now. (Was #57: the
  transport-dot tooltip opening upward.)
- #58 (R32 revision): Settings moved out of the sidebar into an appbar gear pill;
  the device panel is now the bottom element of the sidebar. The sidebar must NOT
  contain a Settings nav button, and the appbar must carry a #appbar-settings-btn
  with data-tab="settings".
- R33: device switch dots (#device-dots) are now the bottom element (below the
  device panel glass card).

Loads the real index.html via file:// in headless Chromium. Skipped if Playwright
/ a browser isn't available (these run when a browser is installed).
