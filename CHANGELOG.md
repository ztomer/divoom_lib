## Round 5 — 2026-06-06 (drag fix completion)

### Fixed

- **Window drag fix (final).** The frameless window drag now works
  on macOS single-monitor and multi-monitor setups. The fix is the
  combination of:
  - pywebview's bundled `pywebview-drag-region` CSS-class mechanism
    (re-enabled on the appbar in `gui/web_ui/index.html:24`).
  - A gated monkey-patch to `webview.platforms.cocoa.BrowserView.move`
    in `gui/gui_main.py:111-128` that drops the `self.screen.origin.x`
    term, fixing upstream
    [pywebview#1820](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview/issues/1820)
    (May 2026). The patch is gated by a source-based detection
    helper `_pywebview_1820_bug_present()` (lines 27-66) that
    inspects `BrowserView.move` and only applies the patch when
    the bug token `self.screen.origin.x + x` is present. When
    pywebview ships the upstream fix, the token disappears from
    the source, the helper returns False, and the patch is
    skipped (logged: "pywebview #1820 already fixed upstream;
    skipping patch"). When that happens, the entire block in
    `gui_main.py:96-128` can be deleted.
- **Self-deactivation contract verified.** Two new tests in
  `tests/test_gui_drag_instrumented.py`:
  - `test_pywebview_1820_detection_matches_source` — canary that
    fails if the detection token no longer matches the bug
    signature in the installed pywebview. This is the trigger
    for deleting the workaround.
  - `test_pywebview_1820_detection_simulates_upstream_fix` —
    monkey-patches `webview.platforms.cocoa.BrowserView.move`
    into the upstream-recommended fix shape and asserts the
    detection returns False. Verifies the self-deactivation
    contract.

### Changed

- **`gui/gui_main.py`** — added the detection helper and gated
  the patch application. ~40 LOC added.
- **`tests/test_gui_drag_instrumented.py`** — added 2 new
  detection-contract tests (4 → 6 total). Updated
  `test_gui_main_patches_cocoa_drag` to assert the new
  structure (detection helper present, patch body does not
  contain the bug token).
- **`docs/PLANNED_WORK.md`** §5 #0 — updated status table
  entry to point to the new history file and document the
  self-deactivation contract.
- **`docs/PLANNING_ROUND2_CONTINUATION.md`** §1 — corrected
  the original §1 dialectic recommendation (Approach A was
  rejected by implementation). Added §14 documenting the
  final 4-attempt journey.

### Added

- **`docs/DRAG_FIX_HISTORY.md`** — full history of all 4
  drag fix attempts, why each failed, what the final correct
  fix is, and how to undo the workaround when pywebview ships
  #1820. Future maintainers: read this before "simplifying" the
  drag mechanism.

### Removed

- **Custom JS drag handler** from `gui/web_ui/app.js` (had
  caused 2 of the 4 failed attempts to jump around).
- **Custom Python `drag_window`** from `gui/gui_api.py` (was
  the source of 3 failed attempts, including a 16ms Timer
  debounce that was theoretically correct but missed the
  real bug).

### Test count

- Before: 484 passed / 73 skipped / 0 failed.
- After: 486 passed / 73 skipped / 0 failed (+2 detection-
  contract tests).
- No regressions. Wall-clock full suite: 66.85s.

### Upstream status

- **pywebview#1820 still OPEN** as of 2026-06-06. No PR, no
  branches. The monkey-patch is still required.

## Round 4 — 2026-06-05 (cover upload, 0x44→0x49 remap)

### Fixed

- **`set animation frame` command was 0x44, now 0x49.** Per the
  protocol summary (`docs/DIVOOM_PROTOCOL_SUMMARY.md`) and APK
  reference, 0x44 is a *single-frame static image* command, and
  0x49 is the *multi-frame animation* command. The library was
  remapping `show_image` through 0x44 with the multi-frame body,
  which the device parsed as a static image and silently dropped
  subsequent frames. `divoom_lib/models/commands.py:36` now
  reads `"set animation frame": 0x49`. Single-frame "animations"
  worked by coincidence — 0x44 + first-frame bytes happens to
  parse as a valid static image.
- **Multi-frame 0x8B 3-phase protocol** implemented in
  `divoom_lib/display/animation_8b.py` (142 LOC) and routed from
  `divoom_lib/display/__init__.py:show_image`. Falls back to
  0x49 if the device rejects the 0x8B handshake.
- **32×32 PixooMax support** — new encoder in
  `divoom_lib/utils/divoom_image_encode_32.py` (119 LOC) +
  C encoder in `divoom_lib/native_src/image_encode_32.c` (286 LOC).

### Test count

- 448 passed / 73 skipped / 0 failed (up from 369).
- +79: 27 encoder + 1 time kwarg + 2 deleted make_framepart/chunks
  + 28 wall canvas + 11 native 32×32 parity + 10 0x8B chunker.

### Files

- `divoom_lib/models/commands.py:36` — remap to 0x49.
- `divoom_lib/display/animation_8b.py` — new, 0x8B 3-phase.
- `divoom_lib/utils/divoom_image_encode_32.py` — new, 32×32 encoder.
- `divoom_lib/native_src/image_encode_32.c` — new, 32×32 C encoder.
- `divoom_lib/native/image_encoder.py` — 432 LOC, wraps C fast path.
- `tests/test_native_image_encoder_32.py` — 11 parity tests.
- `tests/test_e2e_mock_device.py::test_show_image_emits_0x49_frames`
  — renamed from `test_show_image_emits_0x44_frames`.

### Live device

- 2 live-device verifications (4-quadrant, half-green/red) ✓.
- C encoder byte-identical to Python encoder (40/40 parity tests).
- 0x49 push correctly framed and ACKed by device.
- Multi-frame cycling on Timoo: deferred (device firmware behavior
  requires additional commands not yet identified).

## Round 3.5 — 2026-06-05 (P1 helpers, sound, game)

### Added

- **`divoom_lib/system/control.py`** (75 LOC) — `Control` class with
  `set_keyboard` (0x23), `set_hot` (0x26), `set_light_mode` (0x45).
- **`divoom_lib/display/design.py`** — 0xBD sub-cmd dispatch:
  `set_eq`, `set_language`, `set_user_define_time`,
  `get_user_define_time`.
- **`divoom_lib/system/sound.py`** — `SoundControl` class with
  song display, power-on voice vol, ambient sound, auto
  power-off. Registered on `Divoom`.
- **`divoom_lib/game.py`** (167 LOC) — `hide_game`, `set_key_down`
  (0x17), `set_key_up` (0x21), `set_magic_ball_answer` (0x88),
  `exit_game`, 9 game ID constants.
- **26 P1 helper tests** in `tests/test_round4_p1_helpers.py`.

### Test count

- 408 → 448 passed (+40), 73 skipped, 0 failed.

### Live device

- All 4 devices (Pixoo 16×16, Tivoo Max, Ditoo, Timoo) live-tested.

## Round 3 — 2026-06-05 (cover upload, 0x44→0x49)

- (Merged into Round 4 above.)

---

## Round 2 — 2026-06-05 (drag, channel-switch, perf)

- **Drag fix attempts 1-3** — all reverted. See
  `docs/DRAG_FIX_HISTORY.md` for the journey.
- **`display_image` wrapper** — implemented in
  `divoom_lib/display/__init__.py:display_image` as a thin
  alias for `show_image` + optional `wait_for_display` poll.
  8 unit tests in `tests/test_display_image_wrapper.py`.
- **BLE start_notify guard** — added `_notifications_started`
  flag in `divoom_lib/ble_transport.py`. Bug was real;
  macOS CoreBluetooth raises "Characteristic notifications
  already started" if `start_notify` is called twice without
  a `stop_notify` in between.
- **Push to Device button** — layout was already correct
  from Round 0/1; added 2 Playwright regression tests in
  `tests/test_monthly_best_button_visible.py`.
- **C downscaler perf profile** — confirmed hypothesis (a)
  from `PLANNED_WORK.md §6`: 99% of samples in
  `downsample_lanczos3` inner loop. Fix deferred (4-pixel
  NEON deinterleave is a follow-up). Byte-exact path is
  shipped and not user-blocking.
- **Test count:** 354 → 369 → 380 → 408 → 448 → 484 → 486.

## Round 1 — 2026-06-04 (hands-on followup, 6 issues)

- 1a: Love (pulse) is rainbow, not pulse — solid-color pulse 12s
  linear `love-color-cycle`.
- 1b: Color picker not visually distinct — dashed border + "+"
  SVG icon; click opens picker.
- 2: Window drag jumps between two positions — rAF-throttle in
  `widgets.js`; final-mousemove-only semantics. **Later reverted
  in favor of the Round 5 final fix** (see `DRAG_FIX_HISTORY.md`).
- 3: Gallery only "NeonSkull" — `load_cached_gallery` rebuilds
  from `cache_gallery/` when stale; 233 items recovered.
- 4a/4b: Live cover art — visualiser removed; manual 144×144
  push button in Live Widgets music card.
- 5: Stocks preview outside container bounds — `min-width: 0` on
  flex children.
- 6a/6b: System monitor — removed white panel; 3 labeled bars
  (CPU/MEM/BAT) with device-matched colors; removed duplicate
  `const sysmonDisplayBtn`.

---

## Round 0 — 2026-06-04 (visual regression, 8 issues)

- 1: Window drag regression (first occurrence) — move handler
  to `app.js`, `clientX/Y`, `preventDefault`, document delegation.
- 2.1: Custom Art button always visible — `flex:1; min-height:0`
  on scroll container, button pinned.
- 2.2: Color-picker wrapper click delegation — `<div>` →
  `<label>`; remove `channels.js` delegation block.
- 2.3: Ambient layout per Kare/Rams.
- 3: Ambient preview fixes (5 modes) — Love=solid-color pulse;
  Plants=16×16 pixel grid; Sleeping=green; No-mosquito=orange 40%.
- 4: Monthly best empty space — `flex:1; min-height:0` chain on
  gallery card.
- 5: Live widgets — multiple regressions (visualizer removed,
  sysmon = colored bars, `bindCardSelection` re-attached).
- 6: Device selector sidebar — speaker/res moved to Settings
  "Connectivity" sub-tab; preview image enlarged to 120×120.
- 7: Cleanup — dead `.appbar-device` CSS removed;
  `appbarSelect` → `sidebarDeviceSelect`.
- 8: Phasing (A–E) — all phases A–E executed.
